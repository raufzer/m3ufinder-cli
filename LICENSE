Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

- Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.


- Terms and Conditions

1. You may copy, distribute, and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.
2. You can use this software for commercial purposes, but you must disclose the source code and license it under GPLv3.
3. You cannot hold the original author liable for any damages.
4. If you distribute this software, you must include a copy of this license.

For the full list of rights and obligations, refer to the official [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
